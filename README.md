Team Variance (consisting of Steven Cocke, Terry Johnson, and Brandon de la Houssaye) has been commissioned by DDSAnalytics to analyze and interpret certain data covering employee data.

In particular, Client has requested that Team Variance address the following questions:
-what are the factors that contribute to employee attition.
- What insights, if any, can we find about job role.
- What recommendations would be had to develop a predictive tool or next steps.
- As well as handful of specific queries such as the relationship between income, gender, and age.

This repo contains all deliverables, working files (including a code book), and source documents needed to complete this engagement.
